# JAX Git Workshop

A collection of notes from a class on GIT put on by Github instructors at a JAX conference.  The notes and examples are a great primer on use of GIT from a terminal sessions vs. all the GUI options available today.

The notes I added recently I found from another Github instructor as my instructors notes were no longer available.  I copied the notes I found here to have as a reference.
